# What is Virtual DOM
## VIRTUAL DOM
- Can't directly update HTML
- Acts as a copy of the real DOM, which can be frequently manipulated and updated without a page refresh.
- More of a pattern than a specific technology.
- Sync with the real DOM with 'react-dom'

## REAL DOM
- Directly updates and manipulates HTML
- Creates a new DOM / Full repaint if it is updated.
- An Object-Based representation of an HTML document + an interface for manipulating that object.

# Is the Virtual DOM the same as the Shadow DOM?
- NO. That's a separate browser - specific technology.
